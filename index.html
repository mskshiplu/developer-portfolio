            <p>Assersby were left stunned by the University of Nevada Las Vegas student’s stunt and many shared videos
                on social media. The videos show him climbing the building without any protective gear. “Walking to get
                coffee in San Francisco and this dude is just climbing a building,” a user wrote as he shared the video.
                People inside the building also shared clips showing the “trespasser” climbing up</p>

                    Wix or Weebly should not at all concern you about a future in web design/development. It’s important
                    to note that Wix and Weebly are more related to design than development, you aren’t really
                    developing anything in them as such.</P>
